# Laughy - an app to make you laugh
While attending a fascinating internship at a software company I was taught fundamental programming skills as well as structuring and developing a mobile application. 
After successfully finishing it, my next goal was to repeat the learned and build a own mobile application. 
By doing this I would also be able to showcase my expertise.

Laughy, what a crazy name, has two main features. Here is a short overiew.
The first one includes getting jokes by selecting a specific category, but also creating and editing your own jokes.
The second one simply enables you to communicate with a yoda translator (I'm a little star wars fan).

If you have further interest in this app, feel free to look into the fils :)
Should you find some really bad mistakes or you just wanna give me the on or other tipp, please hit me up!

One quick reminder:
I developed this application with Xamarin.Forms on windows. Therefore i was not able to test the code for iOS (UWP was also ignored)
