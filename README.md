# Laughy - an app to make you laugh
While attending a fascinating internship at a software company I was taught fundamental programming skills as well as structuring and developing a mobile application. 
After successfully finishing it, my next goal was to repeat the learned and build my own mobile application. 
By doing this I would also be able to showcase my expertise.

Laughy, what a crazy name, has two main features. Here is a short overview.
The first one includes getting jokes by selecting a specific category, but also creating and editing your own jokes.
The second one simply enables you to communicate with a Yoda translator (I'm a little star wars fan). However this feature is yet in progress and more on a test basis.

If you have further interest in this app, feel free to look into the files :)
Should you find some really bad mistakes or you just wanna give me one or another tip, please hit me up!

Two quick notes:
1. Of course, I am well aware that they are plenty of ways to improve this application or rather expanding it like any other app, but it works great and I am thrilled to work on many other projects. Additionally, I have to say that my focus was definitely way more on the code behind, so logic & architecture.
2. I developed this application with Xamarin.Forms on Windows. Therefore I sadly was not able to test the code for iOS (UWP was also ignored).
