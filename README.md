# Laughy - an app to make you laugh
While attending a fascinating internship at a software company I was taught fundamental programming skills as well as structuring and developing a mobile application. 
After successfully finishing it, my next goal was to repeat the learned and build my own mobile application. 
By doing this I would also be able to showcase my expertise.

Laughy, what a crazy name, has two main features. Here is a short overview.
The first one includes getting jokes by selecting a specific category, but also creating and editing your own jokes.
The second one simply enables you to communicate with a Yoda translator (I'm a little star wars fan). However this feature is yet in progress or stopped at the moment.

If you have further interest in this app, feel free to look into the files :)
Should you find some really bad mistakes or you just wanna give me one or another tip, please hit me up!

Two quick notes:
1. Of course, I am well aware that they are plenty of ways to improve this application or rather expanding it like any other app, but it works great and I am thrilled to work on many other projects. Additionally, I have to say that my focus was definitely way more on the code behind, so logic & architecture.
2. I developed this application with Xamarin.Forms on Windows. Therefore I sadly was not able to test the code for iOS (UWP was also ignored).
